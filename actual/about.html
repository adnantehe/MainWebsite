                     <h1>About Me</h1>
                     <p>My name is Habib Kabuli and I am a student at UNSW studying a Bachelors of Engineering Degree with honours, in the field of Mechatronic Engineering. Throughout the degree, coursework has incorporated the usage of multiple coding languages which developed my exposure to programming.</p>
                     <h2>Projects</h2>
                       <p> The languages of Python coupled with MySQL and HTML was utilised to develop a website.</p> <p> Another project involved the consistent use of C++ in the Visual Studios IDE which enabled us to develop a control system for a 4 wheeled vehicle. This system incorporated the usage of an MSI,PCM and other hardware components to recieve and send signals from the controller to the actuator. The vehicles 'eyes' was done through implementing LiDAR technology. The data received from the LiDAR was then displayed graphically on OpenGL and MATLAB.</p>
                    <p>Projects completed outside of university include the Magic Mirror project, which utilises a microprocessor (Raspberry Pi) to power a screen mounted on the back of a mirror. The mirror is desilvered around the screen and thus allows the screen to have a "pass through" effect. This results in the screen being able visible and also being a mirror. The project was furthered with additional modules that allow for connectivity with Amazons Alexa and other IoT products. The modules on the screen can be modified and personalised e.g Calendars, localised weather reports and news etc</p>
